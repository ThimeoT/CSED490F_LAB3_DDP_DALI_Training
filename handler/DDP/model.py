    ''' Problem 4: model to DDP
    (./handler/DDP/model.py)
    Implement model_to_DDP function.
    model_to_DDP function is used to transfer model to DDP, SIMILAR with DP.
    Be careful for set devices. Set profer device id is important part in DDP.
    '''
    device = torch.cuda.current_device()
    model = model.to(device)
    return DDP(model, device_ids=[device])
